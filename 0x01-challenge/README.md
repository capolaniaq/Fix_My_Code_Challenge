# 0x01. Fix my code

By Guillaume, CTO at Holberton School


## Tasks

### 0. Server status

I just started a new Flask project and the first thing I’m putting in place is a route for the status of my API (super important for a load balancer implementation).

But I don’t know why it’s not working…

Could you look at it and fix it please?

My code is  [here](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/QLSNWfASOa3-_X1gcOZYCQ "here")

### 1. My square

I love geometry!

Look  [my square](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/square.py "my square"), it’s perfect? No? Should I change something?

### 2. Step 2: User model

I’m running into a serious problem!

I just start my OOP project and nothing works…

Could you help me please? My code is  [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/user.py "here").

Thank you!
